# Here are the first nine images from the training dataset.

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
for images, labels in train_ds.take(1):
  for i in range(9):
    ax = plt.subplot(3, 3, i + 1)

# You can train a model using these datasets by passing them to model.fit (shown later in this tutorial). 
# If you like, you can also manually iterate over the dataset and retrieve batches of images:
for image_batch, labels_batch in train_ds:
  print(image_batch.shape)
  print(labels_batch.shape)
  break
# The image_batch is a tensor of the shape (32, 180, 180, 3). 
# This is a batch of 32 images of shape 180x180x3 (the last dimension refers to color channels RGB). 
# The label_batch is a tensor of the shape (32,), 
# these are corresponding labels to the 32 images.
# You can call .numpy() on either of these tensors to convert them to a numpy.ndarray.
# Standardize the data
normalization_layer = tf.keras.layers.Rescaling(1./255)
# There are two ways to use this layer. You can apply it to the dataset by calling `Dataset.map`:
normalized_ds = train_ds.map(lambda x, y: (normalization_layer(x), y))
image_batch, labels_batch = next(iter(normalized_ds))
first_image = image_batch[0]
# Notice the pixel values are now in `[0,1]`.
print(np.min(first_image), np.max(first_image))

# Or, you can include the layer inside 
# your model definition to simplify deployment. 
# You will use the second approach here.

# Note: If you would like to scale pixel values to `[-1,1]` 
# you can instead write `tf.keras.layers.Rescaling(1./127.5, offset=-1)`

# Note: You previously resized images using the `image_size` argument of `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`. 
# If you want to include the resizing logic in your model as well, 
# you can use the `tf.keras.layers.Resizing` layer.

# Configure the dataset for performance
# Let's make sure to use buffered prefetching so you can yield data from disk without having I/O become blocking. These are two important methods you should use when loading data:

# Dataset.cache keeps the images in memory after they're loaded off disk during the first epoch. This will ensure the dataset does not become a bottleneck while training your model. If your dataset is too large to fit into memory, you can also use this method to create a performant on-disk cache.
# Dataset.prefetch overlaps data preprocessing and model execution while training.
